Sometimes we have to use a private key to ssh to a server. This is the default method of access to Amazon EC2 instances. The private key is generated and must be downloaded when the new instance is created.

The key file must be kept secret! Anyone who has a copy of this file can gain access to the server.

The key file can be passed to ssh

    ssh -i /path/to/key.pem user@server

We could also install the key file in order to ssh without having to pass it as an option.

   sudo vi /etc/ssh/ssh_config

Install the key file by mapping it to the IP address of the server

    Host xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
      IdentityFile /path/to/key.pem
      Port 22
