This is a quick way to allow ssh to a server without having to type in a password.

On the the local machine run

    ssh-keygen -t rsa

Then install the key on server

    scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub user@server:~/

    cat ~/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

The file ~/.ssh/authorized_keys might not exist yet. And we want to append to it thus the double >

Lastly delete the temporary file

    rm ~/id_rsa.pub

The following command should now run on the local machine without prompting for a password.
