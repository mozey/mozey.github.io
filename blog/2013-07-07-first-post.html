<p>The first post to my blog was made on a wintry morning in Ceres.</p>
<p>May there be many more to come!</p>
<h6 id="edit-2015-01-08">Edit 2015-01-08</h6>
<p>After trying a couple of different static site generators and not really finding a good workflow I abandoned the idea of posting my technical notes to a blog. It was just easier to keep a collection of text files on my hard drive.</p>
<p>Yesterday I resurrected mozey.tk using python, flask and strapdown.js. Hopefully it will stick this time.</p>
<h6 id="edit-2015-12-23">Edit 2015-12-23</h6>
<p>dot tk started charging money for their domains and the interface is not the best. I like the new domain name better anyway.</p>
<p>Now using github pages and some very simple bash scripts to generate strapdown pages from markdown files. Hopefully these scripts will also go on github soon, after being streamlined a bit.</p>

<p>Had issues with making strapdown pages searchable. Now using Pandoc to pre-render markdown</p>
