The first post to my blog was made on a wintry morning in Ceres.

May there be many more to come!

After trying a couple of different static site generators and not really finding a good workflow I abandoned the idea of posting my technical notes to a blog. It was just easier to keep a collection of text files on my hard drive.

Yesterday I resurrected mozey.tk using python, flask and strapdown.js. Hopefully it will stick this time.

dot tk started charging money for their domains and the interface is not the best. I like the new domain name better anyway.

Now using github pages and some very simple bash scripts to generate strapdown pages from markdown files. Hopefully these scripts will also go on github soon, after being streamlined a bit.
