The first post to my blog was made on a wintry morning in Ceres.

May there be many more to come!

After trying a couple of different static site generators and not really finding a good workflow I abandoned the idea of posting my technical notes to a blog. It was just easier to keep a collection of text files on my hard drive.

Yesterday I resurrected mozey.tk using python, flask and strapdown.js. Hopefully it will stick this time. </xmp>
