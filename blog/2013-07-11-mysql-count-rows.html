Count a rows from a single table.

    select count(*) from myTableName;
    
View rows counts from all tables as reported by the information schema, this is not always up to date and might not give back exact row counts.

    SELECT table_name, table_rows FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = 'myDatabaseName';


Another option to get exact row counts is to use this query:

    select concat(
        'select "', 
        table_name, 
        '" as table_name, count(*) as exact_row_count from ', 
        table_schema,
        '.',
        table_name, 
        ' union '
    ) 
    from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES 
    where table_schema = 'myDatabaseName';
